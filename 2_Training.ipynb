    "\n",
    "Begin by setting the following variables:\n",
    "- `batch_size` - the batch size of each training batch.  It is the number of image-caption pairs used to amend the model weights in each training step. \n",
    "- `vocab_threshold` - the minimum word count threshold.  Note that a larger threshold will result in a smaller vocabulary, whereas a smaller threshold will include rarer words and result in a larger vocabulary.  \n",
    "- `vocab_from_file` - a Boolean that decides whether to load the vocabulary from file. \n",
    "- `embed_size` - the dimensionality of the image and word embeddings.  \n",
    "- `hidden_size` - the number of features in the hidden state of the RNN decoder.  \n",
    "- `num_epochs` - the number of epochs to train the model.  We recommend that you set `num_epochs=3`, but feel free to increase or decrease this number as you wish.  [This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) trained a captioning model on a single state-of-the-art GPU for 3 days, but you'll soon see that you can get reasonable results in a matter of a few hours!  (_But of course, if you want your model to compete with current research, you will have to train for much longer._)\n",
    "- `save_every` - determines how often to save the model weights.  We recommend that you set `save_every=1`, to save the model weights after each epoch.  This way, after the `i`th epoch, the encoder and decoder weights will be saved in the `models/` folder as `encoder-i.pkl` and `decoder-i.pkl`, respectively.\n",
    "- `print_every` - determines how often to print the batch loss to the Jupyter notebook while training.  Note that you **will not** observe a monotonic decrease in the loss function while training - this is perfectly fine and completely expected!  You are encouraged to keep this at its default value of `100` to avoid clogging the notebook, but feel free to change it.\n",
    "- `log_file` - the name of the text file containing - for every step - how the loss and perplexity evolved during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not sure where to begin to set some of the values above, you can peruse [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) and [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf) for useful guidance!  **To avoid spending too long on this notebook**, you are encouraged to consult these suggested research papers to obtain a strong initial guess for which hyperparameters are likely to work best.  Then, train a single model, and proceed to the next notebook (**3_Inference.ipynb**).  If you are unhappy with your performance, you can return to this notebook to tweak the hyperparameters (and/or the architecture in **model.py**) and re-train your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Describe your CNN-RNN architecture in detail.  With this architecture in mind, how did you select the values of the variables in Task 1?  If you consulted a research paper detailing a successful implementation of an image captioning model, please provide the reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** <br>\n",
    "- The CNN-Encoder is a **ResNet** (Residual Network). These kind of network help regarding to the vanishing and exploding gradient type of problems. The main idea relies on the use of <u>skip connections</u> which allows to take the activations from one layer and suddenly feed it to another layer, even much deeper in the neural network and using that, we can build ResNets which enables to train very deep networks. In this project I used the ResNet-152 pre-trained model, which among those available from PyTorch : https://pytorch.org/docs/master/torchvision/models.html , is the one that is performing best on the ImageNet dataset. <br>\n",
    "This might seem unrelated to judge the architecture to use in the encoder based on the accuracy on a totally different dataset, but what I found interesting is that in section **5.2. Evaluation Procedures** of the paper `Neural Image Caption Generation with Visual Attention (2015)`, the authors found that using more recent architectures such as GoogLeNet (Inception) (winner ILSVRC 2014) or Oxford VGG (3rd place ILSVRC 2014) can give a boost in performance over using the AlexNet (winner ILSVRC 2012). So encoder architecture matter !\n",
    "- The RNN-Encoder consists in a <u>single LSTM layer</u> followed by a <u>fully-connected (linear) layer</u>, this architecture was presented from the paper `Show and Tell: A Neural Image Caption Generator (2014)` https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf (figure **3.1**) \n",
    "\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Concerning the hyperparameters:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>`batch_size = 32`: Using a minibatch size of 32 allows us to speed up the computations and reducing the variance (since we are averaging over <batch_size> examples). <br>Yann LeCun posted something about it recently (https://www.facebook.com/yann.lecun/posts/10155247100752143) : \"Training with large minibatches is bad for your health.\n",
    "More importantly, it's bad for your test error.\n",
    "Friends dont let friends use minibatches larger than 32.\" (to read with a little sense of humor !)<br>\n",
    "        There are also interesting answers in Quora : https://www.quora.com/Intuitively-how-does-mini-batch-size-affect-the-performance-of-stochastic-gradient-descent</li>\n",
    "    <li>`vocab_threshold = 6`: With a vocabulary threshold of 6, the total number of tokens in the vocabulary is 8099, which is acceptable. Truth is we did not really need to set this threshold as we are loading our vocabulary, but this is just a reminder that we used such a threshold when building our vocabulary file.</li>\n",
    "    <li>`embed_size = 512` and `hidden_size = 512`: From `Show and tell`, section **4.3.1 Training Details** : \"We used 512 dimensions for the embeddings and the size of the LSTM memory\". As my personal opinion, having used the word2vec pre-trained model (https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/) that uses an embedding size of 300, a value of 512 seems right. I don't have an intuition concerning the <hidden_size>, so I am trusting the paper there.</li>\n",

    "### (Optional) Task #2\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we have provided a recommended image transform `transform_train` for pre-processing the training images, but you are welcome (and encouraged!) to modify it as you wish.  When modifying this transform, keep in mind that:\n",
    "- the images in the dataset have varying heights and widths, and \n",
    "- if using a pre-trained model, you must perform the corresponding appropriate normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the transform in `transform_train`?  If you left the transform at its provided value, why do you think that it is a good choice for your CNN architecture?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** <br>\n",
    "The input of the CNN-encoder accepts an image of size (224 x 224 x 3), hence this is the final size of the image we are aiming for. Before doing that, we can augment our training data by randomly cropping an area of the image after resizing the image to 256. We also use a horizontal flip to augment our data with a probability of 0.5 and then convert the image to a Tensor. Finally we normalize the image by the values used for the ImageNet-dataset so that we are consistent with the pre-trained model. <br>\n",
    "Note that I thought of adding a random brightness transform as another use of data augmentation technique, but then realize that some images still needed to have consistent light to have accurate prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #3\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you will specify a Python list containing the learnable parameters of the model.  For instance, if you decide to make all weights in the decoder trainable, but only want to train the weights in the embedding layer of the encoder, then you should set `params` to something like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "params = list(decoder.parameters()) + list(encoder.embed.parameters()) \n",

    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the trainable parameters of your architecture?  Why do you think this is a good choice?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** <br>\n",
    "The CNN-encoder is taken from a pre-trained model so that we do not need to retrain the model from scratch. However to respond to our task, we to modified the last fully-connected layer to adapt the network to our task (which is not to classify 1000 classes as in ImageNet, but rather, transforming our input image into a feature vector). <br>\n",
    "Furthermore, as of Batch Normalization layer, we need to add it too to our list of trainable parameters. In fact the goal of Batch Normalization is to normalize the outputs of a given internal layer of a neural network. We have the output given in https://pytorch.org/docs/master/nn.html#batchnorm1d : <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y= \\frac{x - E[x]}{\\sqrt{Var[x] + \\epsilon}} * \\gamma + \\beta$$\n",
    ", and we observe at first that we are trying to normalize our output by a standard normal of mean 0 and standard deviation 1 $\\rightarrow$  N(0, 1) (epsilon is here for numerical stability). However, the $\\gamma$ and $\\beta$ parameters are learnable so that the mean and standard deviation is modulated by our own data.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "As of the RNN-decoder, we are training it from scratch, so we take all of the parameters to be able to train all of the weights in the decoder. \n",

    "**Question:** How did you select the optimizer used to train your model?\n",

    "Generation with Visual Attention (2015)`, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf (section **4.3. Training Procedure**) it was shown that the Adam (Adaptive Momentum) algorithm performed the best results. <br>\n",
    "In general an adaptive optimize is always preferable since we keep track of the previous gradient to not end up in a local minima. <br>\n",

For now, we strongly encourage you to train your model for the suggested 3 epochs without worrying about performance; then, you should immediately transition to the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**) to see how your model performs on the test data.  If your model needs to be changed, you can come back to this notebook, amend hyperparameters (if necessary), and re-train the model.\n",

    "To assess potential overfitting, one approach is to assess performance on a validation set.  If you decide to do this **optional** task, you are required to first complete all of the steps in the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**); as part of that notebook, you will write and test code (specifically, the `sample` method in the `DecoderRNN` class) that uses your RNN decoder to generate captions.  That code will prove incredibly useful here. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you decide to validate your model, please do not edit the data loader in **data_loader.py**.  Instead, create a new file named **data_loader_val.py** containing the code for obtaining the data loader for the validation data.  You can access:\n",
    "- the validation images at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/images/train2014/'`, and\n",
    "- the validation image caption annotation file at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/annotations/captions_val2014.json'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The suggested approach to validating your model involves creating a json file such as [this one](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi/blob/master/results/captions_val2014_fakecap_results.json) containing your model's predicted captions for the validation images.  Then, you can write your own script or use one that you [find online](https://github.com/tylin/coco-caption) to calculate the BLEU score of your model.  You can read more about the BLEU score, along with other evaluation metrics (such as TEOR and Cider) in section 4.1 of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf).  For more information about how to use the annotation file, check out the [website](http://cocodataset.org/#download) for the COCO dataset."
